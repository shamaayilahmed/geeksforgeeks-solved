/*Description - Given a sorted array arr[ ] and a number x, We have to count the occurrences of x in arr[ ].
Input : [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3] , x = 2
Output : 4
Solution : Linear Search We can traverse the array and count the number of occurences of x in the given input array.
Time Complexity : O(n)
Since Array is sorted, can we optimize the solution using binary search.

Solution: Binary Search We can solve this problem using binary search by reducing the effective search space in each step. We will be using these steps -
Use Binary search to get the index of the first occurrence of x in arr[ ]. Let the index of the first occurrence be i.
Use Binary search to get the index of the last occurrence of x in arr[ ]. Let the index of the last occurrence be j.
Return the count as difference between first and last indices (j â€“ i + 1);
